# LSW_Test

This is a top-down mini game.
The player can move up and down, left and right with " W , S , A , D " buttons.
The player can interact by approaching some objects.
For example, talking to the seller and buying clothes, opening and closing the curtains of the dressing room,
and finally, by entering the dressing room, he can change the clothes he bought or already had.

For this project I used some pre written codes such as 'EventSytem' and 'CharacterDialogue'.

The reason for the low quality of the art of this game is that I am not an artist and I found all of them on the internet.
